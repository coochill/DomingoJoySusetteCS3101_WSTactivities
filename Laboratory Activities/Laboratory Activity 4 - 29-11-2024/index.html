            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Joy Susette V. Domingo</strong>,<strong> born on September 24, 2002</strong>, in <strong>Cabuyao City, Laguna</strong>. I am an <strong>introvert</strong>. I always hear the impression that I look snobbish, but I'm actually approachable.</p>

            <h2>Likes</h2>
            <p><strong>Blackpink</strong> really saved me during the pandemic. Before that, I was an anime girl, but Blackpink has become a lifestyle.
                <p> <strong>I am a scaredy-cat and am afraid of the dark</strong>, yet I love horror movies that blow my mind and keep me up at night. <strong>I enjoy dark films</strong> but cannot stand gory ones.</p>
                <p>I can eat an entire lemon as a snack, as <strong>I love sour-tasting foods</strong>.</p><p>Lastly,  <strong>Ethel Cain is my mother.</strong></p>

            <h2>Favorite Person</h2>
            <p><strong>Betina Nicole </strong>is my <strong>best friend </strong>and <strong> wife</strong> at the same time, and <strong>I love every piece of her.</strong></p>

            <h2>Dislikes</h2>
            <p>I hate <strong>loud noises</strong>, especially when people have loud conversations and aren't aware of their surroundings. I particularly dislike it when it's happening in my dorm. As for <strong>men... </strong>do I really need to explain it? And <strong>Bergens</strong>. Just Bergens. Bergens. Bergens.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p><strong>I love exploring things</strong> but tend to get bored once I've learned them, so I move on to something else that I feel I can do, which humbles me.</p>
                <p>Since I was a kid, <strong>I loved drawing</strong>, but I never put much effort into it as much as I loved it.
                    <p>During the pandemic, I taught myself <strong>how to play the guitar</strong>, recorded some songs, and even sang for my favorite person.</p>
                    <p>I'm always <strong>active and hyper </strong>, so <strong>playing sports</strong> like <strong>basketball, track, and football</strong> is my go-to outlet.</p>

                <h2>Favorite Movies & Series</h2>
                <p>I enjoy <strong>psychological-thriller and sci-fi genres</strong>, especially those revolving around space and time. However, I'm quite picky when it comes to <strong>comedy films</strong>. My <strong>biggest turn-offs</strong> in both movies and series are <strong>sex scenes and excessive gore</strong>. Some of my favorite movies and series include:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Arcane</li>
                    <li>Erased</li>
                    <li>Bottoms</li>
                    <li>Yellowjackets</li>
                    <li>Derry Girls</li>
                    <li>Perfect Blue</li>
